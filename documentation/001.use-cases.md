## Use Case 1: Simple Message Exchange

### Overview

Users or services send messages to each other through Kafka topics. This enables asynchronous communication and decouples the sender and receiver.

### Flow

1. **Sender:** Publishes a message to a Kafka topic (e.g., `messages`).
2. **Receiver:** Subscribes to the topic and receives messages in real time or on demand.

### Benefits

- Reliable delivery of messages.
- Decouples sender and receiver logic.
- Supports one-to-one or one-to-many messaging.

### Example Kafka Topics

- `messages`

## Use Case 2: Chat Message Reading

### Overview

The application enables users or services to read chat messages from Kafka topics, supporting real-time or on-demand access to conversation data.

### Flow

1. **Chat Producer:** Publishes chat messages to a Kafka topic (e.g., `chat-messages`).
2. **Chat Consumer:** Subscribes to the topic and reads incoming chat messages, displaying them to users or processing them as needed.

### Benefits

- Reliable and scalable chat message delivery.
- Decouples chat message production and consumption.
- Supports real-time and historical message access.

### Example Kafka Topics

- `chat-messages`
