## Use Case 1: Simple Message Exchange

### Overview

Users or services send messages to each other through Kafka topics. This enables asynchronous communication and decouples the sender and receiver.

### Flow

1. **Sender:** Publishes a message to a Kafka topic (e.g., `messages`).
2. **Receiver:** Subscribes to the topic and receives messages in real time or on demand.

### Benefits

- Reliable delivery of messages.
- Decouples sender and receiver logic.
- Supports one-to-one or one-to-many messaging.

### Example Kafka Topics

- `messages`

## Use Case 2: Notification Delivery

### Overview

The application sends notifications (such as alerts or updates) to users or other services using Kafka topics.

### Flow

1. **Notification Producer:** Publishes notification events to a Kafka topic (e.g., `notifications`).
2. **Notification Consumer:** Listens for new notifications and processes or displays them to users.

### Benefits

- Ensures notifications are delivered reliably.
- Allows for scalable notification distribution.
- Decouples notification logic from other application components.

### Example Kafka Topics

- `notifications`
